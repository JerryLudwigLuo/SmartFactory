## FAQ
### I have no write access - how to participate?
This is a safety feature. Before you can make changes to the files present in this repository, you have to **fork** it, meaning you create a copy of this repo to which you have full write access. After you made some changes, you can then issue a **merge request** to push your changes to the original (**upstream**) repository.

**IMPORTANT!!** Your fork does not update automatically. If there are changes in the original (upstream) repo, you have to sync your fork.
